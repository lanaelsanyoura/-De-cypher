# -De-cypher
-De-cypher is an assignment written for the "Introduction to Computer Programming" course at the University of Toronto, St. George campus. The faculty of this course wrote starter code which I, Lana El Sanyoura have built on. 

When paired with the cypher program, -De-Cypher encrypts and decrypt messages.
